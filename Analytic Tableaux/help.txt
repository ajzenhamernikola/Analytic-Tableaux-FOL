PROPOSITIONAL CALCULUS SYNTAX
=============================

1) <symbol> is any identifier (as in programming language C) which starts with 
small letter.

2) <atomic_formula> is:
    2a) true        -- keyword which represents "T", "1", etc.
    2b) false       -- keyword which represents "N", "0", etc.
    2c) <symbol>    -- logic variable

3) <formula> is:
    3a) <formula> <=> <formula>	    -- biconditional (if and only if)
    3b) <formula> => <formula>      -- implication (implies, if...then)
    3c) <formula> | <formula>       -- disjunction (or)
    3d) <formula> & <formula>       -- conjunction (and, and then)
    3e) ~<formula>                  -- negation (not, it is false that)
    3f) <atomic_formula>            -- atomic formula (true, false or a logic 
                                       variable (see 2))
    3g) (<formula>)                 -- parentheses are permitted
   
4) <input> is:
    <formula>;

Therefore, a symbol ';' is used as a input terminator.

ORDER OF PRECEDENCE
===================

Binary operators have lower precedence than unary operators. Among the binary
operators, the order of precedence from the highest to the lowest is: 
&, |, => and <=>.
To change the order of precedence one can use the parentheses. They can also be
used in the cases when they are not necessary. 

ASSOCIATIVITY
=============

All binary operators are left-associative.
